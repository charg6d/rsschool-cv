I'm 27 years old and it is my second attempt to try myself in programming or similar to it. There is no doubt that the technical skills are already neccesary for almost every modern perosn, so I decided to try again.  And I hope that my actual skills from the job will help me with all the difficulties.

I have no actual skills in programming at the moment.

Code example:

function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}

Have no working experience in IT.

Belarusian National Technical University, Economist-Manager, Logist.
No finished IT-courses.

English B2.
