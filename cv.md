I'm 27 years old and it is my second attempt to try myself in programming or similar to it. There is no doubt that the technical skills are already neccesary for almost every modern perosn, so I decided to try again.  And I hope that my actual skills from the job will help me with all the difficulties.

Code example:

function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
